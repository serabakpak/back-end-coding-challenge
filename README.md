# Back End Engineering Challenge

## Goal

Build a RESTful JSON API for data for talks at a conference and attendees

### Requirements

- Demonstrate use of REST conventions
- Include routes to:
	- get a list of all talks
	- get a list of all attendees

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express

## Instructions to download

1. Install Node.js
2. Run npm install

## Decision Making
I chose to build this JSON API on Node and Express since the General Assembly website is built on the MEAN Stack.

With more time, I would build out a database in order to pursue the stretch goal of including a route to add an attendee to a talk.
